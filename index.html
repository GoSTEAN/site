        <h2>SHADOW MANCER</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.google.com">Mance</a> is a slender man and of middling height, but broader in the chest and shoulders and taller than Rattleshirt. His long brown hair has gone mostly to gray, and laughter lines appear at the corners of his mouth. Mance has a sharp face with shrewd brown eyes.

        Mance has a fondness for music, especially wildling songs. Some consider his voice passable and his playing fair. He also has a passion for free folk women.

        Mance wears wool and leather, over which he drapes a slashed cloak of black wool and red silk from Asshai. He armors himself with black ringmail and shaggy fur breeches. Mance's helm is bronze and iron and has raven wings at each temple. Although recognized as King-Beyond-the-Wall, he does not wear a crown or carry a sceptre. Mance's great tent is made from the white pelts of snow bears and is topped with the antlers of a giant elk.</p>
